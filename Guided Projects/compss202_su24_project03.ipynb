    "As recounted by [Metcalfe (2011)](https://www-bmj-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/content/317/7167/1248.3.full.print), Geoffrey Marshall (1887-1982) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) of the UK conducted what some have called the first \"randomized curative trial\" of streptomycin on patients with pulmonary tuberculosis between 1946 and 1948. The earliest clinical trial is usually identified as the efforts by [James Lind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lind) to understand treatments for sailors in the Royal Navy afflicted with scurvy. Modern [randomized controlled trials (RCTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) randomize participants into control and treatment groups; usually are double-blinded, meaning that both participants and investigators do not actively know which group a participant is in; and usually give placebos to the control group.\n",

    "[Tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis) is a deadly disease that still plagues less developed regions of the world. The [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis#tab=tab_1) rates TB as the \"world's top infectious killer.\" Following the earlier discovery of penicillin, [streptomycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin) was first isolated in soil from New Jersey in 1943. According to Metcalfe (2011), high costs of producing streptomycin motivated the British government to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine its efficacy.\n",

    "\n",
