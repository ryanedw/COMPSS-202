    "Consider the following dataset from the 8th wave in 2006 of the [U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS)](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about). It includes observations on objective height and weight and years of education for 2,063 male-female coupled dyads. Males are coded as “respondents,” whose variables start with the prefix \"r,\" and females are coded as \"spouses,\" with an \"s.\" Wave-specific variables are indexed by the next character in the variable name, like `r8heightbio` for objective height measured in wave 8 and `ragender` for the respondent's gender. Height and weight were measured by an interviewer during an enhanced face-to-face interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because males and females tend to have different heights, I dropped 24 same-sex dyads from the dataset to simplify the analysis. Same-sex couples are interesting and equally deserving of research focus, but their numbers are too small within the original HRS sample for us to examine them.\n",
